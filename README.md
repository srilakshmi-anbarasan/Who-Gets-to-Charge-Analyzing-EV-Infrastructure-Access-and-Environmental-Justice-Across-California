# Who-Gets-to-Charge-Analyzing-EV-Infrastructure-Access-and-Environmental-Justice-Across-California


This project examines whether public electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure in California is distributed equitably across communities, particularly once differences in local EV ownership are taken into account. Using Python and data scraping methods, we collected and integrated data from multiple public sources relating EV registration, public charging station access, demographic data, and environmental-justice indicators to capture how infrastructure availability aligns with local demand.

Our analysis shows that EV adoption itself is highly unequal across California and is strongly associated with socioeconomic factors such as income, educational attainment, and housing values. After controlling for EV adoption, there are still disparities in public charging access in communities across California. Specifically, lower-income and more disadvantaged communities face greater charger scarcity and higher EV-to-charger ratios. Taken together, these patterns indicate that public charging infrastructure has not been allocated solely based on need and may instead reinforce existing social and economic inequalities. Together, the findings highlight the importance of equity-focused planning to ensure that the benefits of California’s transition to electric transportation are shared more broadly.
